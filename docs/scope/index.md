The current scope of the project is to incorporate a new Dutch corporation with the Chamber of Commerce (
KvK), using a 'BV' as legal entity.
The corporation also referred to as company later, will have multiple directors and will get at least 10 employees.
A Notary (KNB) is managing the screening and validation of the new corporations and its future directors and supporting
the incorporation process. After the corporation is registered with the KvK, the registration with
the Tax Office (Belastingdienst) needs to happen. The Tax Office will issue a TAX/RSIN number.
Once the corporations is incorporated with the KvK, the directors open a bank account for the corporation.
