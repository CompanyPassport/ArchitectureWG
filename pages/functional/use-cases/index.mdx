  Overview

CompanyPassport is aiming to facilitate use cases that benefit from Electronic Attestations of Attributes (verifiable digital credentials) and wallets for legal entities. This type of technology is relatively new and not yet broadly adopted. However, the implementation of eIDAS 2.0 will provide an enormous boost for this technology an open a range of new opportunities. More specific regional, domain or use case specific agreements have to be specified to ensure interoperability within a digital ecosystem. This is the role for trust frameworks like CompanyPassport.

CompanyPassport will start with the initial [use case of “Founding a Company”](./use-cases/founding-a-company) but several other use cases may be added. Some examples in the table below.
