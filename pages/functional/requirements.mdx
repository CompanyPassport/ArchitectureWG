## Personal Wallet

Personal Wallets are an important component in the Company Passport. Organisational Wallets need to work in combination with Personal Wallets, where PID, Authorised Director, and other personal Attesations can be stored. For the version of the Organisational Wallet, Personal Wallets are required to adhere to the requirements set forth in the [EU Architecture Reference Framework](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/v1.3.0/docs/arf.md)
