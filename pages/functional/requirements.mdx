## Personal Wallet

Personal Wallets are an important component in the Company Passport. Organizational Wallets need to work in combination with Personal Wallets, where PID, Authorized Director, and other personal Attestations can be stored. For the version of the Organizational Wallet, Personal Wallets are required to adhere to the requirements set forth in the [EU Architecture Reference Framework](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/v1.3.0/docs/arf.md)
