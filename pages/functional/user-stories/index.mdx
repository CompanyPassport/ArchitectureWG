The user stories for the Organisational Wallet are separated into four categories:

- [User Stories - General](./user-stories/general) - General user stories not tied to a specific role.
- [User Stories - Holder](./user-stories/holder) - For receiving and presenting Attestations in the Organisational Wallet
- [User Stories - Issuer](./user-stories/issuer) - For issuing Attestations from the Organisational Wallet
- [User Stories - Verifier](./user-stories/verifier) - For requesting and verifying Attestions from external wallets
- [User Stories - Founding a Company](./user-stories/founding-a-company) - User Stories specific to the use case of founding a new "Besloten Vennootschap" (BV)

## Non Functional Requirements

This section lists the non-functional requirements for the Organisational Wallet (some may be more technical requirements and extracted later).

- 24/7 availability
- Try to align with DIIP and ARF (where possible)
- Attestations must be able to be linked to a hardware backed cryptographic key

## Actors

The user stories use certain actors in their descriptions. When such an actor is used within a user story, it should use the contstrains for that actor as described in the the following list of actors. This helps reduce redundancy in user story descriptions.

### Authorized Representative

An Authorized Representative is a natural person that has access to the Organisational Wallet and is authorized to act on behalf of the Legal Entity (possibly indirectly through other Legal Entities). In the current version of the company passport specifications, an Authorized Representative always has full power of attorney to make decisions on behalf of the legal entity.
