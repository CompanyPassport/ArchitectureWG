  Attestation Verification
</Title>

Attestation Verification as defined in the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) is based on the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations ([OID4VP]) protocol. This page outlines the specific flows that need to be supported for Attestation Verification within Company Passport.

## OpenID for Verifiable Presentations

Attestations presented in an online scenario MUST be presented using the [OID4VP] protocol. In addition implementations MUST support the Batch Credential Endpoint. An Issuer MAY support deferred credential issuance, which MUST be supported by the Wallet. Both the Issuer and Wallet MUST support the Notification Endpoint for updates from the Wallet to the Issuer.

The Organizational Wallet can act as both Verifier and Wallet.

### Attestation Formats

Both the Verifier and Wallet MUST support the `vc+sd-jwt` (for the [SD-JWT VC Attestation Format](./attestation-formats.mdx#sd-jwt-vc)) and `mso_mdoc` (for the [ISO/IEC 18013-5 mDL Attestation Format](./attestation-formats.mdx#isoiec-18013-5-mdl)) formats as defined in [Appendix A of OID4VP][OID4VP]. Other attestation formats MAY be supported. See [Attestation Formats](./attestation-formats) for requirements around supported Attestation Formats.

### High Assurance

For additional security, requirements as defined in [Section 5. of High Assurance Interoperability Profile (HAIP)](https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0-00.html#name-openid-for-verifiable-prese) MUST be supported in Company Passport solutions. In addition to the `client_id_scheme` as defined in HAIP, Company Passport Solutions can also use `client_id_scheme` value `did` for using a [Decentralized Identifier](./identifiers.mdx#decentralized-identifiers).

<Callout>
  Support might be added for the `entity_id` as `client_id_scheme` value for integration with [OpenID Federation as
  Trust Management](./trust-management.mdx#2-openid-federation)
</Callout>

### Cross Device Flow

![Cross Device Flow](/assets/oid4vp-cross-device.svg)

<details>
<summary>Cross Device Flow in-depth</summary>

1. User browses to Relying Party (RP) website
2. Browser on the user's device opens the Resource server/website associated with the RP on a device different from its
   wallet
3. The RS/website asks the RP component via its management API to generate a new Authorization Request URI
4. The RP generates a new `state` value which for instance can be used as a browser session using a secure HTTP only
   cookie, referred to as correlation id.
5. RP generates an ephemeral key pair to be used for key agreement for response encryption (not supported yet)
6. RP generates an OpenID4VP Authorization Request, binding it internally to the `state` and stores
7. RP makes sure the Request is accessible using the unique `request_uri` (
   e.g., `https://rp.example.com/oid4vp/requests/abcde-abcde-1234`);
   - The request is bound to the user's browser session
   - It is signed using a key bound to the RP's metadata that can be retrieved using the RP's client_id
   - It contains the presentation_definition containing the information about the requested (Q)EAAs
   - It contains RP's nonce and state
   - It contains the purpose given by the RP
8. RP returns the Request to the RS/RP website
9. Rs/RP website generate a QR code from the Authorization request
10. Rs/RP website returns a HTML page to the browser containing a QR-Code to the wallet app (
    e.g., `openid4vp://authorize?client_id=..&request_uri=https://rp.example.com/oidc/request/1234`). It also sets a
    Cookie with the `state` value.
11. The user launches his wallet and hits a button to scan QR-Code from the RP's website.
12. The wallet scans the QR code
13. The Wallet starts the OID4VP flow
14. The wallet decodes the Authorization Request from the QR-Code and extracts request_uri and client_id
15. The wallet optionally evaluates the trust associated with the client_id of the RP (optional)
16. The wallet app retrieves the Authorization Request Object from the RP website (
    e.g., `https://rp.example.com/oid4vp/requests/abcde-abcde-1234`)
    Example signed JWT when `client_id_scheme` is `did`. This is a vp_token only, meaning only presentation definition
    and thus Verifiable Presentation is expected

header:

```json
{
  "typ": "oauth-authz-req+jwt",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "kid": "did:example:123#1"
}
```

body/payload:

```json
{
  "client_id": "did:example:123",
  "client_id_scheme": "did",
  "response_types": "vp_token",
  "redirect_uri": "https://relying-party.acme.org/callback",
  "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
  "presentation_definition": "..see PE chapter for examples..",
  "client_metadata": {
    "vp_formats": {
      "jwt_vp_json": {
        "alg": ["ES256", "ES256K"]
      },
      "mso_mdoc": {
        "proof_type": ["ES256"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

17. The RP website return the signed Authorization Request Object JWT
18. The wallet validates the Authorization Request signature (JWT) using the RP's public key

- Was the signature valid and the key bound to the RP's metadata? This ensures that the Authorization Request was not
  tampered with;

19. The wallet validates the Presentation Exchange's Presentation Definition to be valid (presentation_definition)
20. The wallet optionally filters out any Verifiable Credentials that cannot satisfy the presentation_definition
21. The wallet notifies the user in case credentials are missing. Or to be more precise, in case presentation_definition
    input descriptors cannot be satisfied.

- In the future a trust framework could would list all issuers and their credential types, allowing for a nicer UX, by
  redirecting the user to (Q)EAA Providers in case credentials are missing.

22. Consent: The Wallet displays information about the identity of the Relying Party and the purpose, the user gives
    consent to present the (Q)EAA.
23. **JSON-LD W3C (Q)EAA** The wallet generates a W3C Verifiable Presentation containing one or more proofs using
    wallet/device private key(s)
24. **(SD-JWT (Q)EAA)** The Wallet generates a KB-JWT by signing over nonce and audience with _device private keyv_
25. **(SD-JWT (Q)EAA)** The Wallet creates the presentation according to presentation_definition by cutting out the
    unnecessary Disclosures and appending the KB-JWT
26. **(Mdoc (Q)EAA)** The Wallet generates an Mdoc deviceAuth by signing the SessionTranscript with _device private key_
27. **(Mdoc (Q)EAA)** The Wallet creates the presentation according to presentation_definition by cutting out the
    unnecessary Releases assembling the issuerAuth with deviceAuth
28. **JWT W3C VP** The wallet generates a W3C VCDM 1.1 JWT encoded Verifiable Presentation containing one or more proofs
    using wallet/device private key(s)
29. The wallet asks the user to authenticate, for instance using pin, face id or fingerprint
30. The wallet creates a VP token and a presentation submission, describing the paths from the definition to the VC(s)
    contained in the VP.
31. The wallet sends the VP token and presentation submission to the RP (encrypted to the RP's ephemeral public key, not
    yet supported).
32. The RP optionally decrypts the Authorization Response with its _ephemeral public key_ created during the
    Authorization Request.
33. The RP matches the browser session with the state parameter.
34. The RP verifies the content of the vp_token. verifies its signatures, including these of credentials contained in
    presentation(s)
35. The RP verifies the submission_data and vp_token against its definition
36. The RP responds with HTTP 200 and acknowledges the received vp_token.
37. The browser refreshes the RP's website, either by polling regularly or by receiving a call from the RP, e.g. through
    websockets or webhooks.
38. The RP matches the session_id from the Cookie
39. matches this with the verification result.
40. Returns the result to the browser or RS
41. The browser continues the UX flow.

<summary>DIF Presentation Exchange in-depth</summary>

Whenever the `response_type` of the `Request Object` contains the value `vp_token`, `code` and
a `presentation_definition` is present, the OP/Wallet is expected to return a so called `VP Token`, meaning a Verifiable
Presentation in the `Authorization Response` (`vp_token`) or `Token Response` (`code`) with `presentation_submission`,
binding the Presentation to the definition. Examples will be provided below.

### Example JWT (Q)EAA

Below is an example (Q)EAA in JWT format, explaining how the JWT encoded (Q)EAA is being mapped onto the W3C Verifiable
Credential Datamodel 1.1 (VCDM).
It is important to understand that a JWT (Q)EAA is just a matter of encoding/decoding a 'regular' W3C Verifiable
Credential

```json
{
    "iss": "https://example.gov/issuers/565049", <-- Maps onto the issuer value of the W3C VDM
    "nbf": 1262304000, <-- Maps onto the issuance data of the W3C VDM
    "jti": "http://example.gov/credentials/3732", <-- Unique value, maps onto the credential Id of the W3C VDM
    "sub": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21", <-- maps onto the credentialSubject id of the W3C VDM, notice no id is present below,
    "vc": { <-- maps onto the W3C VCDM Verifiable Credential. The rest below is standard W3C VCDM,
       "crdentialSchema": {
          "id": "https://eu.com/claims/IDCredential.json"
       },
        "@context": [
            "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
            "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
        ],
        "type": [
            "VerifiableCredential",
            "IDCredential"
        ],
        "credentialSubject": {
            "given_name": "Max",
            "family_name": "Mustermann",
            "birthdate": "1998-01-11",
            "address": {
                "street_address": "Sandanger 25",
                "locality": "Musterstadt",
                "postal_code": "123456",
                "country": "DE"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Example Presentation Definitions

As you can see in the below examples the format of the actual credential has an influence on the definition. Both in
terms of paths, formats and constraints

The global structure however is the same, and follows the DIF Presentation
Exchange [v2.0 specification](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/) (PE)
The `input_descriptor` array is mandatory. A wallet is supposed to satisfy every single input descriptor from the
definition, unless specific constraints dictate otherwise.

Please be aware that the below are very minimal examples of what PE is capable of.
Things like defining which claims should be used in selectively disclosed credentials, including whether the selective
disclosure is mandatory or optional are for instance possible.
It is also possible to add constraints to an input descriptor, allowing for instance to assign one or more groups to the
descriptor. The in a so called `submission_requirements` object you can have rules, like a `pick` rule where you define
that for instance 1 or 2 descriptors should be satisfied from a certain group, or for instance a min and max amount of
descriptors

#### W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model 1.1 JWT Credential

The below example, expects a JWT VP signed using `ES256` with a single JWT VC signed using either `ES256` or `ES256K`.
It also expect the type to be `IDCredential` exactly and requires a schema from 2 different locations.

```json

    "name": "An optional human friendly readable name, to be displayed by a wallet typically",

    "input_descriptors": [
        {

                        ],
                        "filter": { <-- Can be any JSON schema filter, so partial searches using regexes, matching against constants, singular values as well as arrays

                            }
                        }
                    },
                   {

                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Presentation Submission

A descriptor called the `presentation_submission` needs to be provided in the Response to the RP. This descriptor is
being created by the Wallet and User. The Wallet will use a PE library to filter out any non-conforming (Q)EAAs. If the
Presentation Definition cannot be met, the user will be warned about it. If it can be met, the user will have to
consent. In case multiple (Q)EAAs met a single criteria (input_descriptor) of the definition, the user should choose
which (Q)EAA(s) to use.
The PE library then will generate the `presentation_submission`, making a link between the definition `input_descriptor`
ids and the JSONPaths of the (Q)EAAs in the Presentation. This ensures the RP can check the Presentation without any
ambiguity.

Example presentation submission:

```json
{
    "id": "Presentation example 1", <-- Unique value in scope of the holder/wallet
    "definition_id": "example_jwt_vc", <-- Matches the definition Id (see earlier)
    "descriptor_map": [
        {
            "id": "id_credential", <-- matches the ID of the descriptor from the definition
            "format": "jwt_vp", <-- Format used for the presentation
            "path": "$", <-- Since this is a nested descriptor where the outer part is the presentation at the toplevel, we use $ (toplevel)
            "path_nested": { <-- We need to point to the VC/(Q)EAA within the presentation
                "format": "jwt_vc", <-- format of the VC
                "path": "$.vp.verifiableCredential[0]" <-- Path to the (Q)EAA, relative to the path of the parent ($)
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
