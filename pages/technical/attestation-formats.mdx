## SD-JWT VC

[SD-JWT VC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/03) is one of the attestation formats required in the Architecture Reference Framework for issuance of PIDs and (Q)EAAs.

A Company Passport solution MUST support draft 03 of SD-JWT VC.

<Callout variant="accent">

The Architecture Reference Framework currently refers to SD-JWT VC as the required SD-JWT specification. However, in a future version of the ARF this will likely be updated to a version of [SD-JWT VC DM](https://github.com/danielfett/sd-jwt-vc-dm).

Due to the experimental stage of SD-JWT VC DM Company Passport will for now follow the requirements set forth in the Architecture Reference Framework.

### Cryptographic Algorithms

For signing of the SD-JWT VC and the Key Binding JWT, at least the signing algorithm `alg` value `ES256` in combination with the elliptic curve `crv` value `P-256` MUST be supported according to [Cryptographic Algorithms](./cryptographic-algorithms).

For digests of disclosures the `_sd_alg` value of `sha-256` MUST be supported according to the SD-JWT VC specification and [Cryptographic Algorithms](./cryptographic-algorithms).

### Issuer Identification and Key Resolution

The Attestation Provider of an SD-JWT VC MUST include a verifiable identifier as the value of `iss` payload claim. At least DID Document Resolution, JWT VC Issuer Metadata, and X509 Certificates according to [Identifiers](./identifiers) and [section 3.5 of SD-JWT VC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-03#name-issuer-signed-jwt-verificat) MUST be supported.

### Key Binding

When cryptographic Key Binding is to be supported the `cnf` claim MUST contain a confirmation method identifying a proof of possession key.

At least the `jwk` confirmation method MUST be supported according to [Identifiers](./identifiers) and [Section 3.2 in RFC 7800](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7800#section-3.2).

When a SD-JWT VC is to be bound to a key within a DID Document, the `kid` confirmation method SHALL be used with a value consisting of a [DID URL](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-url-syntax) that points to a specific key within the DID Document. Depending on requirements, a verifier MAY choose to accept another key in the DID Document as valid proof of possession in the Key Binding JWT.

<Callout variant="accent">
  [Discussion is still ongoing](https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-sd-jwt-vc/issues/205) on how a DID URL should be conveyed as confirmation method. Possibly a new `did` confirmation method will be introduced. Since `kid` has been a widely used method to convey DID URLs, it will be used as confirmation method for DID URLs until the `did` confirmation method has been standardized.

</Callout>

### Revocation

When a SD-JWT VC needs to support revocation, the Token Status List revocation method should be used, as defined in [Attestation Revocation](./revocation.mdx#token-status-list) and [Section 3.2.2.2 of SD JWT VC](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-03.html#name-registered-jwt-claims).
