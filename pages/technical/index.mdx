  Introduction
</Title>

The CompanyPassport technical specifications are a set of requirements for building an organizational wallet, compliant with eIDAS 2.0 and the EU Architecture Reference Framework (ARF). As the CompanyPassport is not a technical component by itself, these specifications set requirements around interoperability, security, and standards that need to be supported by the system. As described in the functional components, how these requirements are implemented is an implementation detail, the components described in this specification can be implemented as one system, or as separate systems working in tandem.

The technical specifications are divided into different sections describing specific components of the system.
