  Company Passport - Specifications
</Title>

Company Passport is a trust framework that is evolved from an NL based innovation
project with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, Dutch Tax Office, ABN AMRO bank,
the Royal Dutch Association of Civil-law Notaries (KNB) and the Dutch Blockchain
Coalition.

The trust framework is intended to facilitate use cases that require validated data
related to legal entities. It uses SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) technologies and should
align with the upcoming eIDAS 2 regulations. It is not a software solution but
describes how compliant software solutions interact. These software solutions can
be provided by any public or private third party.

The initial focus will address NL based use cases. However, the objective is to
assume a cross border, international context that could address all kind of different
uses cases across country borders and different domains. Company Passport work
may provide valuable input to other trust frameworks and initiatives related to
organizational digital identity. For instance the eIDAS/EUDI Wallet LSP’s, EBSI,
Gaia-X, ESG reporting (Environmental, Social, Governance), EU DPP (Digital
Product Passports), ESPR (Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation), CSRD
(Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) etc.

As part of the overall Company Passport trust framework, the architectural and
technical specifications need to be agreed upon and described. This work is carried
out by the Company Passport Architecture Working Group and documented in this documentation
site. You can view the source of this website on the [Company Passport Github](https://github.com/dutchBlockchainCoalition/CompanyPassport/).
